# NHS
In this project, I supported the NHS in identifying patterns in appointment utilisation, staffing needs, and missed appointments using data analytics. By exploring large-scale healthcare data, I translated raw trends into actionable recommendationsâ€”helping inform smarter scheduling, reduce no-shows, and improve resource efficiency across the system
NHS Appointment Trends & Missed Appointments Analysis - 81& Final Grade
This project was completed as part of the LSE Data Analytics Postgraduate Diploma. I explored appointment data across Englandâ€™s NHS system to understand utilisation trends, staffing needs, and missed appointments. The focus was on providing strategic recommendations that improve service efficiency without increasing capacity.

ðŸ§  Business Problem
Missed GP appointments cost the NHS over Â£216M annually. At the same time, stakeholders debated whether current staffing and infrastructure are sufficient. My task was to explore:

Actual utilisation across NHS networks
Trends in missed appointments and their drivers
Whether current capacity is sufficient or needs expansion

ðŸ“Š Analytical Approach Highlights
Data Cleaning & Merging
Cleaned and combined appointments_regional.csv, actual_duration.csv,national_categories.xlsx, and ICB reference data to support trend analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Used Python to uncover trends across appointment modes, lead times, and healthcare roles.

Data Quality Considerations
Flagged and retained 'Unknown' entries to reflect limitations in NHS data collection practices.

Focused Scope
Excluded datasets that were too short (7 months) or uninformative (Twitter data) to maintain clarity and relevance.

ðŸ“Œ Key Insights
GPs handle the highest demand, highlighting their central role in NHS operations.
Face-to-face care is still preferred, even post-COVID, despite the availability of remote options.
Missed appointments increase with long lead times â€” especially bookings >21 days in advance.
Remote modes (Video/Home Visits) have the highest DNA rates, pointing to engagement and tech barriers.
Utilisation remains under 85%, suggesting scheduling inefficiencies, not capacity limits, are the issue.

âœ… Recommendations
Reduce DNAs in Remote Care
Use reminders, app confirmations, and tech support to improve video/online attendance.

Smarter Scheduling
Allocate more same-day slots and use predictive analytics to identify high-risk no-shows.

Fix Data Quality Issues
Standardise dropdown input fields and reduce unknown classifications by 30% in 12 months.
